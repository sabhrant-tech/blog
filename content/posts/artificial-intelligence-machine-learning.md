# Introduction

Hi there, welcome to a series on **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**. AI/ML is now starting to become big in the tech industry with involvement from various big players such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft. And there are multiple terms such Generative AI, RAG, Tranformers and so on which are confusing and may lead to misunderstanding. This series is an attempt to provide a high-level view of:
- terms used within AI/ML space
- introduction to AI/ML
- what are the different models used in AI/ML and for what purpose
- latest trends within AI/ML space
- and a few more :joy:

I like the definition shared by IBM for AI/ML.
# What is Artifical Intelligence
> Artificial Intelligence or AI, is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human intelligence and problem-solving capabilities.

*Reference: [here](https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence)*

# What is Machine Learning
> Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science that focuses on the using data and algorithms to enable AI to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

Hope above gives you some context on what is about to come in further posts in this series.
