# What is Machine Learning

We touched on the definition in the last [post]({{< ref "posts/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning.md">}}). Let's expand on this, so machine learning is a process of teaching computers to perform actions which they are not explicitly programmed to perform. Simple put, machine learning is a method of teaching computers to learn from data and improve at performing specific tasks.

There are mainly three types of machine learning:
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

Let's delve into the first two types:

## What is Supervised Machine Learning

In this type of learning, computers are given a set of training data which includes both, input data and desired output. The goal of Supervised Learning is to build a model that can make predictions on new data, based on the patterns learned from input data.

## What is Unsupervised Machine Learning

In this type of machine learning, computer is given only the input data without any desired output. The goal of Unsupervised Learning is to find patterns and relationships among data elements.
