# Hi there

Welcome to my blog. I am starting this blog to help me organize my learnings, thoughts and anything which interests me and is worth taking a note.

I am a software professional with over 18 years of experience with core banking as the domain. I've had the opportunity to work in implementation or engineering team to help clients across multiple geographies. I am married and have a son named, Vihaan. Currently I am located in the 'Silicon Valley of India' Bangalore or Bengaluru.

Hope you find something of interest here.

Thank you for visiting.
